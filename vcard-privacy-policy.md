Contacts Tools - Privacy Policy

Contacts Tools takes its users' privacy very seriously, it will never collect any of your private information. 

Also, it will not read or modify any content on your clipboard without first notifying you.

If you want to export your contact list to an Excel file, this requires that you are allowed to agree to "read contact permissions" and that this data is only processed locally on the device and not uploaded elsewhere.

All features can be used offline.

The AppCenter SDK is integrated inside the application and reports crash logs when the application crashes, which helps us fix bugs and improve the user experience.

The privacy policy for the AppCenter SDK is located at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/gdpr/
