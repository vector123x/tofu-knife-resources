Contacts Tools Privacy Policy

Contacts Tools takes its users' privacy very seriously, it will not read or modify any content on your clipboard without first notifying you.

If you need to export your phone contact list to an Excel file, the application requires you to agree to "Read Contacts" permission before you can export. This contact information will only be written to a local Excel file and will not be collected, uploaded, used or shared.

The AppCenter SDK is integrated inside the application and reports crash logs when the application crashes, which helps us fix bugs and improve the user experience. The privacy policy for the AppCenter SDK is located at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/gdpr/
